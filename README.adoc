= SG Ready Pi Controller

This application is an SG Ready Controller to determine available power vs. power consumption and derive a SG- Ready State.
This is done by reading from a power generator such as PV inverter including batteries and comparing egress/ingress to a power meter reading.

https://www.waermepumpe.de/normen-technik/sg-ready/[SG Ready] is a standard to indicate the following states to an eletrical heater:

* Normal State (No indication, `0:0`)
* Lock (Reduce power consumption, `1:0`)
* Available Power/Low Tariff (Increase Temperature, Indicate that consuming power now would be favorable, `0:1`)
* Switch on Heating/Excess Power (Switch on the heater to consume excess power,  `1:1`)

== Hardware

This project is designed to run on RaspberryPi to benefit from a low-power consuming compute platform.

=== SG Ready Control Signal Handlers

SG Ready signal indication uses external relays to close two independent circuits.
It is similar to using GPIO and pulling an input pin to GND, however, you should expect a potential-free signal source from the heater.

=== Power Meters

Currently supported:

* SMA Sunny Home Manager 2.0 over Speedwire (Multicast)

=== Inverters

Currently supported:

* SMA Tripower over Modbus TCP (more models could be potentially supported)

== Foundation

This project is built with:

* Maven
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot üçÉ]
